                    I am a first year PhD student working with Professor <a href="https://jhalderm.com">J. Alex Halderman</a> at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/> 

                    My research interests lie in the intersection of technology and society, 
                    particularly in the areas of privacy and security. I study problems such
                    as Internet censorship, mass surveillance, and anonymity systems.
                    I am also interested in exploring the disparity in understanding
                    between the developers and users of technology, and the consequences
                    this disparity has on how technology is used, perceived, and legislated.
