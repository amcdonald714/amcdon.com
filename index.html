                    My reearch interests lie in the intersection of technology and society, 
                    particularly in the areas of privacy and security. I am interested 
                    in studying problems such as Internet censorship, mass surveillance, 
                    consumer data abuse and misuse, and digital identity management by 
                    exploring and reducing the disconnect between how technology is 
                    designed and produced and how it is perceived, used, and legislated, 
                    both domestically and internationally.
