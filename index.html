                <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/">Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences</a> 
                at Boston University.</p>

                <p>My research sits at the intersection of privacy, security, and human-centered computing.
                    My goal is to understand how technology exacerbates marginalization using both in-depth qualitative
                    and large-scale data-driven methods. Using these insights, I then work to mitigate inequality through 
                    designing safer systems and providing empirical evidence for policy changes.</p>
