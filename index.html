                <p>I am a third-year PhD student working with <a href="https://jhalderm.com">J. Alex Halderman</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a> at the University 
                of Michigan.</p>

                <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of technology and society, 
                    particularly in the areas of privacy and security. I study topics such
                    as Internet censorship, surveillance, usable privacy, and security education.
                    I am also interested in exploring the disparity in understanding
                    between the developers and users of technology, and the consequences
                    this disparity has on how technology is used, perceived, and legislated.</p>


                <p>I was a <a href="http://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/fellowship/">Roger M Jones Fellow</a> at 
                the European University Viadrina, and my experiences studying human rights law were chronicled 
                on the <a href="https://rogermjones.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/meet-allison/">fellowship blog</a>.</p>
