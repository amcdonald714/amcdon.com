                    First year PhD student working with Professor <a href="https://jhalderm.com">J. Alex Halderman</a> at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/> 

                    My research interests lie in the intersection of technology and society, 
                    particularly in the areas of privacy and security.
                    I am interested in 
                    exploring and reducing the disconnect between how technology is 
                    designed and produced and how it is perceived, used, and legislated, 
                    both domestically and internationally.

                    <br/><br/>Former <a href="http://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/fellowship/">Roger M Jones Fellow</a> at the European University Viadrina, where my experiences were chronicled on the <a href="https://rogermjones.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/meet-allison/">fellowship blog</a>.
